 * like the better question and cannot be answered here: a `tv` object does not belong only to the
 * component its name resembles. `receiptVariants` also dresses `ReceiptLine`, `terminalVariants`
 * dresses `TerminalCommand`, `LayoutPreview` takes `active` per pane out of its data, `SwipeDeck`
 * holds `held` in its own state, and `ToggleGroup` declares `pressed` as two empty strings so a
 * compound variant can name it. Handing any of those to the root does nothing, which reads as a
